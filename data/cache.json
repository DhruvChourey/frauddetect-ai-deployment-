    "reason": "This message is a classic scam tactic. It is unsolicited and lacks crucial details such as the sender's identity, the specific bank or account credited, or the reason for the alleged credit. Scammers use such messages to create curiosity or urgency, often aiming to trick recipients into clicking malicious links (if present), replying with personal information, or calling a fake support number to 'verify' the transaction, which can lead to phishing, identity theft, or financial loss.",

      "Your official bank's mobile app or website (access directly, not via any link in the message) to independently verify actual account activity.",
      "Official bank customer service phone number (obtained from the bank's official website, not from the message itself) if you are concerned about potential impersonation.",
      "Government consumer protection agencies or cybercrime reporting portals (e.g., National Cybercrime Reporting Portal in India) to report the attempted scam."

    "reason": "The phrase 'good morning' is a common greeting and is not inherently malicious. It does not contain any typical indicators of a scam such as requests for personal information, suspicious links, urgent demands, or unusual offers. While benign on its own, such a greeting can sometimes be used as an initial message in a broader scam attempt to establish contact or build rapport.",

    "reason": "This content describes a classic 'double your money' scheme, promising an unrealistic return of 100% in just three days. Such high returns in a very short timeframe with no legitimate underlying investment vehicle are a hallmark of investment fraud, Ponzi schemes, or outright scams designed to trick individuals into sending money with no intention of returning it or providing the promised profits. This is a clear 'too good to be true' scenario.",
